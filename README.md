🌿 Medicinal Plant Identification System
📌 Project Overview

The Medicinal Plant Identification System is a deep learning–based web application developed to automatically identify medicinal plants from leaf images and display their medicinal uses. The system aims to reduce human error in plant identification, especially in the Ayurvedic and herbal medicine sectors, where incorrect plant collection can lead to ineffective or unsafe medicines.

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and a web-based interface for training, testing, and prediction.

🎯 Objectives

To develop an automated system for identifying medicinal plants using leaf images

To apply deep learning (CNN) for feature extraction and classification

To provide an easy-to-use web interface for users

To evaluate system performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
